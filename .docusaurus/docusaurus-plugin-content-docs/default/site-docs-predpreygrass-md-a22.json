  "description": "The Predator, Prey, Grass project aims to investigate behavior of multiple agents in a simple closed grid world. Although only partially applicable to modern humans, this could shed light to ancestral human behavior. In the hunter-gatherer period of Homo Sapiens, roughly 10,000 years ago a common setting, humans could be as well be predators as prey. Moreover, the limited availability of grass could be regarded as a proxy for the limited proximal resources for humans down the food chain.",
