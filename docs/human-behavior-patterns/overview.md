title: Human Behavior Patterns
sidebar_position: 1
---

This project aims to model general human behavior patterns. This modeling of human behavior is meant to be descriptive, rather than prescriptive. Furthermore we aim to integrate state-of-the-art Artificial Intelligence concepts into into modeling human behavior patterns, notably from multi agent reinforcement learning (MARL) and Artificial Life Intelligence.

## What is human behavior?
Human behavior encompasses the spectrum of actions and mannerisms exhibited by individuals within specific environments. It represents how individuals react to various stimuli or inputs, which can be internal or external, conscious or subconscious, overt or covert, and voluntary or involuntary. Typically, the term “behavior” is used to refer to the array of responses that can be observed by others, as exemplified in Display 1. However, the term human behavior in that perspective is subjective as for instance also brain waves can be detected by other people using specialized medical instruments. Therefore, we use the term of human behavior as human responses which can be detected by the natural senses humans encompasses. In that respect we like to define behaviors which are somehow naturaly visible to others, which is metaphorically depicted in Display 1.
