## A closer look into the origins of behavior
Diving deeper into the origins of human behavior beyond the abstract ‘nature’ and ‘nurture’ concepts often result in behaviors which are not strictly just sub-divisions of these two but are rather a mixture of ‘nature’ as well as ‘nurture’. Human behavior is influenced by a complex interplay of various determinants, including biological, psychological, social, cultural, and environmental factors. Understanding these determinants can help to gain insights into why people behave the way they do. Here are some of the key areas and their related determinants of human behavior:

Understanding these factors can help us better comprehend and predict human behavior, but it is still a challenging and evolving field of study.
