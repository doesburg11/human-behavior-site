title: The Sequence in PredPreyGrass MARL
---

The sequence in Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning is of importance in simulation. Therefore, scheduling of the agents’ activation is particularly important and the activation regime can have a substantial effect on the behavior of a simulation [Comer2014]. Most many-agent algorithms can in practice handle only instances where all learning agents step at the same time, because sequentially stepping makes it computationally very difficult to solve.
