title: Epochs variation
---
The number of epochs in the configuration has a strong impact on the wall time of iterations. The ```num_epochs``` determines how many times PPO will re-use the same batch of collected experiences for gradient updates before sampling a new batch of fresh data. Essentially, the ```num_epochs``` is a knob that trades off data efficiency vs. stability. Increasing  ```num_epochs``` increases stability of training but on the other hand takes more compute time.

In Display 1 we depict the wall time for the default PPO configuration (with ```num_epochs=30```), alongside training results for ```num_epochs=20,10,5```. This shows that long term stability of training when ```num_epochs``` decreases.

On the other hand however, Display 2 which depicts the same training but now in wall time on the x-axis, shows that the lower ```num_epochs```, the faster learnings occurs. Especially at the beginning. But on the other hand, training is less sustainable and stable.

This in particular shows the trade off between stability and speed when choosing the ```num_epochs``` in PPO training. An interesting follow-up might be to increase ```num_eppochs``` during training. Because ```num_epochs=5``` gives fast results at the first 100 iterations with the same reward output as the experiments with higher ```num_epochs```. However, after 100 iterations this configuration breaks down. So, starting off training with ```num_epochs=5``` and increasing it after 100 iterations might be result in a significant speed up of wall time, with roughly the same sustainability of training after 100 iterations.

**TODO**:
- ```num_epochs=5``` if ```iteration <= 100```.
- ```num_epochs=20``` if ```iteration > 100```.
- truncation at ```max_iters=500```.
- This might result in a full experiment wall time of 3-3.5 hours compared to the current 9.7 hours (for ```num_epochs=30``` and truncation at ```max_iters=1000```), with roughly the same quality of training.
- Another experiment might be to gradually increase ```num_epochs=5```
 after ```iteration > 100``` in some determinstic way.
