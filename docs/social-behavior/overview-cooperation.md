# Cooperation

This section explores cooperation as a broad class of social behavior in natural and artificial systems.

- General forms: coordination, collaboration, reciprocal exchange, coalition formation, altruism.
- In multi-agent RL: shared goals, joint policies, communication protocols, and emergent conventions.
- In human systems: institutions, norms, and incentives that sustain cooperation.

Future topics here will include subpages on altruism, reciprocity, and coordination mechanisms.
