This project aims to model general human behavior patterns in a descriptive rather than prescriptive manner. Our goal is not to define how people *should* behave, but rather to understand and represent how they *do* behave in real life. We feel that gaining more insight into the reasons *why* people behave the way they do is never waisted. To achieve this, we integrate state-of-the-art concepts from Artificial Intelligence—particularly from multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) and Artificial Life Intelligence—into our modeling of human behavior.
