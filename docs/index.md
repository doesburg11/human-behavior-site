This project aims to explore human **cooperative behavior** by Artificial Intelligence at two complementary levels:

- **Nature** →  Evolving cooperation over generations by selection

- **Nurture** → Learning to cooperate within lifetime

Rather than prescribing cooperative behavior through reward engineering, we investigate the minimal ecological, interactional, and selection constraints under which cooperative behavior emerges  in a multi-agent ecosystem. We explicitly treat life time experience (nurture) and evolutionary selection (nature) as dynamically intertwined processes with feedback loops rather than separable explanatory categories:

- Evolution shapes learning capacities.

- Learning reshapes ecological structure.

- Ecological structure reshapes selection gradients.

Therefore, human cooperative behavior could be viewed as contemporary action based upon ancestral hardware. The origins of curent human cooperative behavior is a blend of events in history ranging from millions of years in the past until split seconds ago, as shown in Display 1 and Display 2.
