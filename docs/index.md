This project aims to model general human behavior patterns with Multi-Agent Reinforcemnent Learning (MARL). One of the most fascinating and controversial aspects of human behavior is **cooperation**. Therefore, this project in particular is focussed on how and under what minimal conditions multi-agent reinforcement-learning agents can learn cooperative behavior that is not explicitly rewarded, scripted, or evolutionarily inherited.
