sidebar_position: 1

This project aims to model general human behavior patterns. This modeling of human behavior is meant to be descriptive, rather than prescriptive. Furthermore we aim to integrate state-of-the-art Artificial Intelligence concepts into into modeling human behavior patterns, notably from multi agent reinforcement learning (MARL) and Artificial Life Intelligence.
